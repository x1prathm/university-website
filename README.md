# University Website Portal (Portable Version)

A simplified and portable version of my University Website project, created so that universities and recruiters can easily run and review it.

## 📌 What’s Inside
- Student login
- Results module
- Contact & support pages
- Academics, campus & about sections
- Frontend in HTML/CSS/JS  
- Backend in PHP (portable version without database setup)

## ⚠️ Note on JSON Changes
The original project used advanced JSON handling and PHP features that required newer PHP versions and extra dependencies.

For resume/academic submission purposes, I **downgraded and simplified the JSON usage** so the project runs on any basic PHP setup (XAMPP/Apache) without errors or configuration issues.

This ensures:
- No version conflicts  
- No missing extensions  
- Easy plug-and-play review  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download the folder  
2. Move to `htdocs` (XAMPP/Apache)  
3. Open: `http://localhost/SPPU_Portable`
